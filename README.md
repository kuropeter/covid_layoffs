# Tech Layoffs during COVID-19 Pandemic

## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze and visualize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tech layoffs. The project includes data cleaning using Python and creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI.

## Data Cleaning:
Python was used for data cleaning and preprocessing. The raw dataset, which contained information about tech layoffs during the pandemic, was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. Various techniques and libraries in Python were employed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format the data for further analysis.

## Dashboard Creation:
Using Power BI, an interactive and visually appealing dashboard was developed to present the insights derived from the cleaned dataset. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of tech layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic, including trends, geographical distribution, affected industries, and more.

Please refer to the project documentation and code files for more details on the data cleaning process and Power BI dashboard creation.
